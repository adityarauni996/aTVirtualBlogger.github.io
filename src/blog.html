    <h2 class="intro"><u>What is AI</u></h2>
    
    <p class="max">AI stands for artificial intelligence. This term was first coined in the midlle of twentieth century by JohnMcCarthy.Mr John played a very important role in the devlopment of intelligent machines. This is a little history about the intelligent machines . Now lets move to our topic what actually is AI.

        We all know that we are living in twentieth century and we are modernalising in technology each and every day one such advancement which is taking pace at very high rates in last few decades is in the field of AI .AI is a term used to describe intelligent machines . Regular machines have zero iq it means that they need commands to perform some activities which is programmed inside it ,it cannot do anything else if that thing is not programmed inside it. But in case of AI this simply does not happen AI can be refferd as intelligent human being which has the performance of a robot and has the capability to make self decisions like humans which makes them more efficient and skiled than humans and regular machines.</p>

        <h2 class="pace">Pace of AI</h2>
    <p class="min">Earth has in the current year that is 2020 a population of more than 7.5 bilion.So it is not possible to manufacture or deliver any types of goods or services manually to each and every individual present, and in coming years the population is only going to increase only , this situation lead to a massive growth of automation and AI field industry . Acoording to Pwc last year AI has contributed a whopiing $2trillion in global GDP and it has beeb predicted that till 2030 it is going to contribute more than $15.7 trillion dollars. If we talk about today time in IT industry software programmers who are making contribution in AI are getting highly paid .Due to such numerous advantages of AI maximum countries and big comnpanies are spending huge amounts on AI projects and digitilization.

        Above you have seen only the advantages of AI but it is said no that every boon comes with a sin</p>

    <h2 class="effects">Disadvantages of AI</h2>
    <p class="mid">From the above text you would have known about how AI sector is profiting or will profit the society in coming years .But there is a suprise for you that as many advantages that AI has that much disadvantages AI is going to have .Let figure them out

        Devlpoment of AI is going to kill jobs of many people .Now you will be thinking how as above it was helping in the growing of economy,
        but as the machines will be self dependent they can make their copies also so this wont require any manforce it will be all automated by itself .
        
        As machines will start thinking of their own they can also feel the greed of occupying things like humans do .So it will create a scene that we see in the movvies
        
        There is a famous quote said by Stephen Hawking that "AI is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity."
        
        At last i will say that devlopment of AI is not a bad thing but it needs to be limited in use by seeing all his uses and misuses</p>
